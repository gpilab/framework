This is the GPI Framework project.  The framework constitutes the main process
that provides a canvas for graphically organizing and assembling algorithm
components called 'Nodes'.  The framework also contains the PyFI C++ interface
for simplifying the generation of Python extension modules.

## Dependencies

components are packaged using conda and hosted on Anaconda.org. They are
bundled in a single installer (the 'GPI Stack') which is available at
