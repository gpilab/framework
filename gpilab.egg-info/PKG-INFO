GPI stands for **G**raphical **P**rogramming **I**nterface which is a development environment for scientific algorithms that provides a visual workspace for assembling algorithms. Algorithm elements (i.e. nodes) can be linked together to form a flow diagram. Each node is executed according to the hierarchy of the diagram.

```shell
$ gpi
```

If you have install GPI from source you can run it as follows:

```shell
$ ./bin/gpi
```

## Compiling PyFI files

You will need to have `fftw` and `eigen` to compile PyFI, you can get them by running the following command:

```shell
$ conda install fftw eigen
```

First navigate to the directory with your PyFI files.

If you have installed GPI using `pip` you can make PyFI as follows:

```shell

```

If you have install GPI from source you can run PyFI as follows:

```shell
$ ./bin/gpi_make --all
```
