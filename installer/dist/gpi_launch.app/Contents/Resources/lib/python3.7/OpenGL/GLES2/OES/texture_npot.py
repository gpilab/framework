'''OpenGL extension OES.texture_npot

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GLES2.OES.texture_npot to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	This extension adds support for the REPEAT and MIRRORED_REPEAT
	texture wrap modes and the minification filters supported for
	non-power of two 2D textures, cubemaps and for 3D textures, if
	the OES_texture_3D extension is supported.
	
	Section 3.8.2 of the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification describes
	rules for sampling from an incomplete texture. There were specific
	rules added for non-power of two textures i.e. if the texture wrap
	mode is not CLAMP_TO_EDGE or minification filter is not NEAREST or
	LINEAR and the texture is a non-power-of-two texture, then sampling
	the texture will return (0, 0, 0, 1).
	
	These rules are no longer applied by an implementation that supports
	this extension.
