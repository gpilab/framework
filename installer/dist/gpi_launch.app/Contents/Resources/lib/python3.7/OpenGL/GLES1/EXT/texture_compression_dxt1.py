'''OpenGL extension EXT.texture_compression_dxt1

This module customises the behaviour of the 
OpenGL.raw.GLES1.EXT.texture_compression_dxt1 to provide a more 
Python-friendly API

Overview (from the spec)
	
	Support of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc is attractive for OpenGL-ES
	implementations because it provides compressed textures that allow
	for significantly reduced texture storage. Reducing texture storage is 
	advantageous because of the smaller memory capacity of many embedded 
	systems compared to desktop systems. Smaller textures also provide a
	welcome performance advantage since embedded platforms typically provide
	less performance than desktop systems. S3TC compressed textures 
	are widely supported and used by applications. The DXT1 format is 
	used in the vast majority of cases in which S3TC compressed textures 
	are used.
	
	However, EXT_texture_compression_s3tc specifies functionality that is
	burdensome for an OpenGL-ES implementation. In particular it requires
	that the driver provide the capability to compress textures into 
	S3TC texture formats, as an S3TC texture format is accepted as the
	<internalformat> parameter of TexImage2D and CopyTexImage2D. Further,
	EXT_texture_compression_s3tc may require conversion from one S3TC 
	format to another during CompressedTexSubImage2D if the <format> 
	parameter does not match the <internalformat> of the texture image 
	previously created by TexImage2D.
	
	In an OpenGL-ES implementation it is therefore advantageous to support 
	a limited subset of EXT_texture_compression_s3tc: Restrict supported 
	texture formats to DXT1 and restrict supported operations to those
	that do not require texture compression into an S3TC texture format or
	decompression from an S3TC texture format.
